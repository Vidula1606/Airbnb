# AIRBNB – Full-Stack Travel Stay Listing Platform

This is my very first full-stack web development project, inspired by Airbnb.  
I built AIRBNB to learn and practice the complete process of designing, developing, and deploying a real-world application — from backend logic to frontend UI.

## About the Project

AIRBNB allows users to:

- Explore travel stay listings with images and detailed descriptions
- Filter listings by categories like Mountains, Castles, Farms, Arctic, etc.
- Sign up and log in securely
- Create new listings with image upload via Cloudinary
- Leave ratings and reviews
- Use the platform on both desktop and mobile devices

## Features

- MVC architecture with Express.js
- Form validation and sanitization using JOI
- Local authentication with Passport.js
- Image uploads with Cloudinary + Multer
- Custom middleware for flash messages and error handling
- RESTful routing and controller separation
- Responsive design using Bootstrap
- Session handling and route protection

## My Learning Journey

This project taught me:

- How to structure and organize a full-stack application
- Implementing secure authentication and handling sessions
- Working with file uploads and external services
- Debugging real-world issues and improving code quality

I spent days coding, testing, debugging, and refining — gaining confidence with each problem solved.

## Future Improvements

- Map visualization with Leaflet.js
- Google OAuth authentication
- More advanced search and filters for better, more relevant results (e.g., only showing Arctic stays if that category is selected)
